Image 1: "Step 7 of assembling the Tuffing shows an illustration of a person attaching long, horizontal metal bars to a pair of parallel metal frames. The person is using a tool to secure the bars, which are likely the side supports of a bed frame."

Image 2: "Step 8 of assembling the Tuffing depicts the attachment of additional bars to the previously assembled metal frame. The main image shows the insertion of a long, thin metal rod through loops or brackets on the frame. Below, two detailed insets illustrate the securing of this rod with a screw and a nut, using a screwdriver and a wrench."
