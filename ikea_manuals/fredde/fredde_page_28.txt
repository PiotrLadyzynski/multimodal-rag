Image 1: Step 35 in the assembly instructions shows the upper section of a bunk bed, identified as the Tuffing model. The image depicts the attachment of a safety rail to the top bunk. The rail is being secured to the bed frame with two screws on each side, as indicated by the "2x" label near the screws. An inset close-up shows the alignment of the screw with the hole on the frame for precise assembly.

Image 2: Step 36 in the assembly instructions continues with the Tuffing bunk bed. This step illustrates the attachment of a ladder to the lower part of the bunk bed frame. The ladder is being fixed in place with two screws, similarly marked with a "2x" label. A detailed inset shows the screw being inserted into the designated hole on the side of the bed frame.

These descriptions should help the system answer questions about the appearance of the Tuffing bunk bed, the parts included in the assembly, and specific assembly steps such as step 4.
