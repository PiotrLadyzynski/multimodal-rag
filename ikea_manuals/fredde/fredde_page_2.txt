fredde page 2. The image is a comic-style instruction sheet, likely from a furniture assembly manual, depicted in a simple line drawing format. It consists of four panels:

1. The first panel shows a figure pointing to a set of tools and hardware items required for assembly, including a screwdriver, a wrench, and a hammer.

2. The second panel depicts two figures assembling a piece of furniture, possibly a table or a shelf. One figure is using a screwdriver while the other is holding the furniture steady.

3. The third panel shows a figure looking puzzled while holding an instruction manual, with a question mark above their head, indicating confusion.

4. The fourth panel features a figure standing near a partially assembled piece of furniture, looking frustrated. The background includes a sign with "IKEA" on it, suggesting the setting is in an IKEA store or the furniture is from IKEA.

Each panel is designed to convey a step or a common scenario encountered during furniture assembly, using humor and simplicity to communicate the challenges and tools involved.
