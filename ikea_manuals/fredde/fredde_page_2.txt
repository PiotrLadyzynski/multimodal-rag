The image is divided into four panels, each depicting different steps in the assembly process of a piece of furniture, possibly a bed frame or similar item. In the top panel, labeled with a large number 1, an illustration shows a hand pointing towards three tools: a screwdriver, a wrench, and a hammer, along with a set of screws and bolts. This panel indicates the required tools and hardware for assembly.

The second panel, marked with the number 2, features two figures working together to assemble a large, flat piece with multiple holes, using a cross-shaped metal support. They are aligning the metal support with the holes in the flat piece.

In the third panel, labeled with the number 3, one figure is shown thinking with a thought bubble containing a question mark, while looking at an open instruction manual. This suggests uncertainty or confusion about the assembly process.

The fourth panel, marked with the number 4, depicts a figure calling the IKEA help line for assistance, as indicated by the IKEA logo on the phone. This panel suggests seeking help due to difficulties encountered during the assembly process.

This image sequence is designed to guide the assembler through the initial steps, highlighting the importance of using the correct tools, following the assembly instructions, and seeking help if needed.
