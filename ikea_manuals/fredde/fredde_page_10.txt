fredde page 10. The images depict assembly instructions for a piece of furniture, likely a bed frame or similar structure.

1. Step 10 shows the assembly of a metal frame:
   - The first image in this step shows a hand using a tool to tighten a bolt on a joint of the metal frame.
   - The second image highlights the insertion of a bolt through aligned holes in the frame parts, with an arrow indicating the direction of insertion.
   - The third image shows a close-up of a bolt and nut being tightened, with a tool applied to the bolt.

2. Step 11 illustrates the installation of cylindrical parts (possibly legs or supports) into the frame:
   - The first image shows two cylindrical parts, each with a detailed view of a screw being inserted into a threaded hole.
   - The second image depicts these cylindrical parts being attached to the underside of the frame, with an indication to repeat the action twice (as shown by the "x2" label).

Each step uses clear, simple line drawings to demonstrate the assembly process, with additional details like arrows and tools to guide the assembly.
