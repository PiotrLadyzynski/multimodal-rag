Image 1: Step 10 of assembling a furniture item. The image shows a metal frame with two elongated side parts. An individual is depicted attaching a curved metal bar to the side parts using a hex key. Two close-up insets show the correct orientation of the screws and the placement of the hex key on the screw.

Image 2: Step 11 of assembling a furniture item. The image illustrates the attachment of cylindrical parts to the base of the metal frame. Two identical cylindrical parts with a screw mechanism are shown being inserted into holes at the base of the frame. The action is repeated twice as indicated by the number "2x" next to the cylindrical parts. The entire frame is visible with all parts connected, suggesting the nearing completion of the assembly process.

These descriptions should help the system answer questions about the appearance of the "Tuffing" and the assembly steps involved, as well as identify the parts included in the "Freda" if similar images are used for its assembly instructions.
