fredde page 19. Alternative text for the IKEA assembly instruction image:

"This image displays step 25 in the assembly instructions for a piece of IKEA furniture, possibly a bunk bed named Tuffing. The top part of the image shows two individuals working together to assemble the frame of the bed. One person is stabilizing the frame while the other is using a tool to secure parts together. The middle part of the image focuses on a detail of the assembly process, showing an arrow indicating the direction to slide a component into the frame. The bottom part of the image provides a close-up view of the assembly detail, showing the insertion of two screws into a joint, with a wrench turning a nut to secure the screws. The label '2x' suggests that this screwing action needs to be repeated twice for proper assembly."

This description should help the multimodal RAG system answer questions about the appearance of the Tuffing, the parts included in the Freda (if similar imagery is used for Freda), and specifically address what is involved in step 4 of assembling the Tuffing if it follows a similar pattern of detailed instructional imagery.
