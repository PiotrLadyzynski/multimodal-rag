Image 1: "Step 33 of assembling a furniture item shows an illustration of a bunk bed frame. A hand is depicted inserting a long, flat metal piece into the upper side of the frame. An inset close-up shows the metal piece being secured into a slot on the frame."

Image 2: "Step 34 of assembling a furniture item features the bunk bed frame with all major components assembled. The focus is on the attachment of eight screws, as indicated by the number '8x' and an arrow pointing to the screws being tightened into the frame. The screws are used to secure the joints of the frame."

These descriptions should help the multimodal RAG system answer questions about the appearance of the "Tuffing" bunk bed, the parts included in the "Freda" (if it were depicted), and specifically about step 4 of assembling the "Tuffing" if it corresponds to one of these steps.
