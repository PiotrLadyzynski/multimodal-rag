fredde page 27. The image contains two assembly instruction diagrams labeled as steps 33 and 34.

Step 33 shows a diagram of a partially assembled furniture piece, resembling a bench with a shelf and a backrest. An arrow indicates the placement of the backrest onto the frame of the bench. A zoomed-in circle highlights how a component should be slotted into another.

Step 34 depicts the same furniture piece with the backrest now attached. There is a zoomed-in circle showing a screw being inserted into a hole, with a notation indicating that eight screws are needed for this step.

The diagrams are clear and use simple line drawings to illustrate the assembly process, typical of furniture instruction manuals.
