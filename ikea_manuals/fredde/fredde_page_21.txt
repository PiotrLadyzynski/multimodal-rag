fredde page 21. The image appears to be an instruction page from a furniture assembly manual. It contains several diagrams illustrating the steps to assemble a piece of furniture, possibly a chair or a small table. Here's a breakdown of the panels:

1. The top panel shows two long, narrow parts crossed out with an "X," indicating they should not be used or a step to avoid.
2. The second panel depicts a chair frame with arrows pointing to where additional parts should be inserted or adjusted.
3. The third panel shows a close-up of one of the chair's sides, with an arrow indicating the insertion of a part into the frame, labeled with "2x," suggesting this step should be repeated twice.
4. The fourth panel shows a side view of the chair frame with a part being slid into place, accompanied by a downward arrow.
5. The fifth panel, similar to the fourth, shows a part being secured into the frame with a downward arrow, and a small square detail indicating where a fastener or connector should be applied.

Each diagram uses simple line drawings and arrows to guide the assembly process, focusing on clarity and step-by-step instruction.
