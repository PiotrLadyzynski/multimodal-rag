fredde page 21. Alternative text for the IKEA assembly instruction image:

"This image displays step 27 in the assembly instructions for a piece of IKEA furniture. The top part of the image shows two long, narrow panels placed parallel to each other with a prohibition sign (a cross) over a screw, indicating not to use screws in this step. Below, there are three sequential images. The first image shows the attachment of a metal bracket to the end of one of the panels, with an arrow indicating the direction to slide the bracket onto the panel. This step is marked to be repeated twice. The second image shows the bracket being secured to the panel with a downward arrow pointing at a screw, suggesting the screw should be tightened. The third image shows a similar action being performed on the other end of the panel with the same downward arrow indicating the tightening of a screw." 

This description should help the multimodal RAG system answer questions about the assembly process depicted in the image.
