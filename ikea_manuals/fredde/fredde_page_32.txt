fredde page 32. The image displays two assembly instruction steps for furniture.

Step 41 shows the assembly of a bench. The image includes a bench with a backrest and armrests. There are arrows indicating the placement of screws and a tool, likely an Allen wrench, used for assembly. The diagram also shows two circular parts, possibly washers or caps, to be placed on the bench, with a quantity indicator "2x" next to them.

Step 42 illustrates the attachment of a shelf to the bench. The diagram shows a cloud-like shape indicating where to insert four screws (indicated by "4x") into pre-drilled holes on the shelf to secure it to the frame of the bench.

Both steps are part of a detailed assembly manual, likely for a piece of outdoor or garden furniture. The page number "32" and some reference codes are visible at the bottom of the image.
