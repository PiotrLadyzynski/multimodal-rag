Image 1: "Step 2 of assembling a piece of furniture shows a close-up of a wooden beam with a pre-drilled hole. A metal dowel is being inserted into the hole, indicated by an arrow. The image includes an inset showing a hand using a tool to tighten the dowel. The tool and dowel are highlighted with a '1x' label, suggesting one piece of each is required."

Image 2: "Step 3 of the assembly process depicts a wooden beam with a metal dowel partially inserted. An arrow indicates the direction to fully insert the dowel into the beam. A curved black arrow shows the motion for a separate component, a curved metal bracket, being attached to the end of the beam with a screw and a tool."

These descriptions provide a clear step-by-step visual guide for assembling parts of a piece of furniture, focusing on the insertion of dowels and the attachment of brackets.
