fredde page 20. Alternative text for the image: "Step 26 of IKEA assembly instructions for a piece of furniture, possibly a bed frame. The main image shows a nearly complete bed frame with a high headboard and a lower footboard, both vertical and attached to a horizontal base. Below the main image, there is a detailed inset showing the attachment of a screw and a locking mechanism, labeled with '2x' to indicate that two of each component are needed. The inset illustrates the alignment and securing of these parts to the structure, suggesting this step focuses on reinforcing the frame's stability."
