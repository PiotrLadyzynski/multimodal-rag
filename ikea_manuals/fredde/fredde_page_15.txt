fredde page 15. Alternative text for the IKEA assembly instruction image:

This image displays a series of illustrations from an IKEA assembly manual. The top section of the image features an overview diagram of a partially assembled bed frame, indicating the focus of the assembly steps. The diagram includes annotations pointing to specific components and assembly details, such as screws and brackets.

Below the overview, there are three smaller images arranged sequentially from left to right, labeled as steps 1, 2, and 3. Step 1 shows a close-up of a wooden beam with a metal bracket being positioned at the end. Step 2 illustrates a hand securing the bracket with a screwdriver. Step 3 depicts the insertion of a dowel into a pre-drilled hole in the beam.

The bottom section of the image presents step 18, featuring the same bed frame with a focus on the attachment of a leg. It shows a detailed view of a screwdriver tightening a bolt through a metal bracket that connects the leg to the frame. The instruction specifies using two bolts for this step, as indicated by the label "2x" next to the bolts.

This image is designed to guide the assembler through specific steps in constructing a piece of furniture, with clear visual cues and minimal textual instructions.
