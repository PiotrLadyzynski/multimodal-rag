fredde page 15. The image is an instructional diagram for assembling a piece of furniture, likely a bed frame or similar structure. It consists of several panels:

1. The top panel shows an isometric view of a partially assembled metal frame with various components labeled, including screws and tools.

2. The middle panel is divided into three steps:
   - Step 1 shows a close-up of a metal beam with holes.
   - Step 2 depicts a hand positioning a bolt through the aligned holes of two metal parts.
   - Step 3 illustrates the securing of the bolt with a nut.

3. The bottom panel, labeled "18", shows the metal frame with a focus on the attachment of a support beam. It includes detailed steps for inserting a bolt through the support beam into the frame, securing it with a nut, and tightening it with a wrench. The instruction indicates to repeat the process for another part of the frame.

Each step includes graphical representations of the tools and hardware needed, such as a wrench and bolts, enhancing clarity for assembly.
