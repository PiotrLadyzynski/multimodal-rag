fredde page 13. The image contains two sets of assembly instructions, labeled as steps 14 and 15.

Step 14 shows the assembly of a metal frame. It involves using eight screws to attach a circular component to a bracket, which is then connected to a larger frame structure. The tools and screws are highlighted, indicating their placement and the direction of assembly.

Step 15 illustrates the attachment of a sliding mechanism to a rectangular frame. Two screws are used to secure a sliding component inside the frame. Arrows indicate the direction in which the screws should be tightened and the direction the sliding component should be moved to ensure it is properly installed.

Both steps include detailed diagrams with parts and tools clearly marked, providing visual guidance for assembly.
