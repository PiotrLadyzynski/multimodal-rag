The image shows the upper frame of the bunk bed with two side railings and a ladder. The focus is on securing the ladder to the bed frame. A close-up inset illustrates the attachment of the ladder using two screws, indicating that this action should be repeated twice. Arrows point downwards, showing where to insert and tighten the screws to secure the ladder to the frame."
