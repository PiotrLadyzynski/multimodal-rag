Image 1: "Step 16 - A line drawing depicts a person assembling a bed frame. The individual is shown in two positions: bending over the frame and adjusting the side rails. The bed frame appears to be a simple, metal structure with four legs and side rails."

Image 2: "Step 17 - A close-up illustration focuses on the assembly of a screw mechanism. A hand is shown using a screwdriver to tighten a bolt through a circular fitting that connects two parts of the bed frame. The image indicates that this action should be repeated twice."

These descriptions are designed to help a multimodal RAG system answer questions about the appearance of the "Tuffing" bed frame, the parts included in a hypothetical "Freda" item, and the specific actions involved in step 4 of assembling the "Tuffing."
