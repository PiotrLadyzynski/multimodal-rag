fredde page 14. The image contains two instructional illustrations for assembling furniture:

1. In the top illustration (labeled "16"), there are two line drawings of a person in two different positions, both interacting with a rectangular frame structure. The person is shown adjusting or assembling parts of the frame, possibly tightening or fitting components together.

2. The bottom illustration (labeled "17") shows a close-up view of hands using a screwdriver to secure a bolt into a hole on a part of the frame. The illustration indicates that two bolts should be used in this step, as denoted by "2x" next to the screwdriver and bolt.

Both illustrations are typical of assembly instruction manuals, using simple line drawings to guide the user through the assembly process.
