fredde page 17. The images depict two steps from an assembly instruction manual for a piece of furniture or equipment.

1. Image 21 shows the assembly of a slatted base into a frame. An arrow indicates the motion of placing two spherical objects (possibly screws or caps) into the frame. The number "2x" suggests that this action should be repeated twice.

2. Image 22 illustrates the attachment of a cylindrical component (possibly a bolt) with a washer and a nut. The diagram shows the bolt being inserted through a hole in the frame and secured with the nut. The number "5x" indicates that this step should be repeated five times.

Both images use simple line drawings and symbols to clearly communicate the assembly steps, and are typical of furniture assembly guides.
