Image 1: "Step 21 of assembling a piece of furniture shows a diagram of a partially assembled bed frame. The image illustrates the attachment of a slatted bed base to the frame using two screws. An arrow indicates the direction to secure the slats onto the frame."

Image 2: "Step 22 of the furniture assembly features a close-up diagram of a screw and a locking nut. The instructions indicate to use five sets of these components. Below this, the image shows the bed frame with arrows pointing to the locations where the screws and nuts should be installed to secure parts of the frame together."

These descriptions should help the multimodal RAG system answer questions about the appearance of the Tuffing bed frame, the parts included in the Freda (if similar parts are used), and specific assembly steps such as step 4 of assembling the Tuffing.
