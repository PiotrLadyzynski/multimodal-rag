Image 1 (Step 39): This image shows the assembly of a bunk bed frame, specifically focusing on securing the upper bunk's safety rail. The illustration depicts the rail being attached to the bed frame using four screws, as indicated by the "4x" symbol next to a screwdriver and screw. The components are shown in a line drawing format, emphasizing the placement of the screws along the top edge of the safety rail.

Image 2 (Step 40): This image continues with the bunk bed assembly, focusing on securing a ladder to the frame. The illustration shows the ladder being attached at two points, each secured with a bolt and nut, as indicated by the "2x" symbol next to a wrench and bolt. The image provides a close-up view of the bolt and nut assembly, highlighting the insertion of the bolt through the ladder and frame, and the tightening of the nut.

These descriptions should help the multimodal RAG system answer questions about the appearance of the "Tuffing" bunk bed, the parts included in the "Freda" (if it were depicted), and specific assembly steps such as step 4 of assembling the "Tuffing".
