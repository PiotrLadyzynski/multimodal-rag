fredde page 29. Alternative text for IKEA assembly instruction images for a multimodal RAG system:

1. Image showing step 37 of assembling a piece of furniture, possibly a bed or bunk bed. The image illustrates the frame of the bed with a focus on the lower section. Arrows indicate the insertion of horizontal slats into the side frames, suggesting the assembly of a lower bunk or shelf.

2. A continuation of step 37, this image focuses on the upper section of the same furniture frame. It shows the insertion of additional horizontal slats into the upper part of the side frames, consistent with the construction of an upper bunk.

3. The third image in the sequence, still part of step 37, depicts the entire frame of the furniture, now with all slats in place for both upper and lower sections. Arrows emphasize the securing of these slats into the frame, indicating the completion of this step in the assembly process.

4. A detailed image showing a close-up of a screw being inserted into a hole on a wooden part of the furniture. This image likely serves as an instructional detail on how to secure the slats or other components firmly using screws.

5. The final image provides a close-up on the insertion of a wooden dowel into a pre-drilled hole in the frame. This step is crucial for stabilizing the structure, ensuring the dowels are properly placed to support the overall integrity of the assembled furniture.

These descriptions should help the multimodal RAG system answer questions about the appearance of the "Tuffing" (if that is indeed the model being assembled), the parts included in a different furniture set like the "Freda", and specific assembly steps such as step 4 for the "Tuffing".
