2. The middle section is labeled with the number "31" and shows a detailed inset. This inset illustrates the correct insertion of a component (a screw or peg) into a hole on the side of another part, emphasizing the correct orientation with a directional arrow.

3. The bottom section features a line drawing of a partially assembled bench. The bench has a backrest and a lower shelf. An arrow indicates the placement of the backrest onto the lower structure, suggesting the next step in the assembly process.

Overall, the image serves as an instructional guide for assembling a specific piece of furniture, focusing on the correct handling and orientation of parts.
