fredde page 25. Alternative text for the image from IKEA assembly instruction:

"This image illustrates step 31 in the assembly instructions for a piece of IKEA furniture. The top part of the image shows two long metal rods, one depicted as correct with a check mark, and the other as incorrect with an X mark and a warning symbol indicating not to twist. Below, there is a detailed inset showing a close-up of a screw being inserted into a hole on a metal bracket, with directional arrows indicating the proper insertion method. The main part of the image features a nearly complete metal bunk bed frame with a lower bunk and side safety rails. The frame is shown with an arrow pointing downwards, indicating the placement of the upper bunk or another component onto the frame." 

This description helps in understanding the specific step and the correct method of assembling the furniture, as well as identifying the type of furniture being assembled (a metal bunk bed).
