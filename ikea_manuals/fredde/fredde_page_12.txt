fredde page 12. The image is an instructional diagram showing the assembly of a piece of furniture, possibly a shelf or a rack. It consists of four separate panels:

1. The top-left panel shows a hand using a tool to tighten or adjust a component on the side of a vertical panel, which is part of the furniture. An arrow indicates the motion of the tool.

2. The top-right panel depicts a hand pressing down on the top of the vertical panel, securing it into place on a horizontal base. An arrow shows the downward pressure being applied.

3. The bottom-left panel features a close-up view of a hand inserting a smaller component (possibly a dowel or connector) into a hole on the side of the vertical panel. An arrow indicates the direction in which the component should be inserted.

4. The bottom-right panel shows a hand sliding a horizontal bar through brackets or holders attached to the vertical panels, completing a part of the frame structure. An arrow indicates the direction in which the bar is being slid.

Each step is clearly marked to guide the assembly process, emphasizing the correct placement and securing of parts.
