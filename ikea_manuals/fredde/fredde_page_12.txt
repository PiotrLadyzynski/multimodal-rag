"This image illustrates step 13 in the assembly process of a piece of furniture. It features three separate diagrams. In the first diagram, a hand is shown using a tool to secure a bolt on the side of a vertical panel, which is part of a larger frame. The second diagram shows a hand pressing down on the top of the frame, indicating the application of pressure to ensure the components are tightly fitted. The third diagram highlights the insertion of a horizontal bar into slots on the frame, with arrows indicating the direction of insertion. Each step is clearly marked to guide the assembly process."
