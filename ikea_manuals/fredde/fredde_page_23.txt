A hand is depicted inserting a long, thin metal rod into the upper frame of the structure. An arrow indicates the direction to slide the rod through multiple pre-drilled holes to secure the frame. The inset circle magnifies the area where the rod is being inserted, emphasizing the alignment with the hole. The overall structure includes a ladder on the right side and a lower level that could be used for seating or another bed. The background is plain to highlight the assembly details."
