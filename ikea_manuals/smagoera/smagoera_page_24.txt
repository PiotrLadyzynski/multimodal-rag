1. Image labeled "20" shows a tall, narrow cabinet with a door slightly ajar. An inset detail illustrates the attachment of a component using four screws, indicated by the label "4x" next to a screw icon and a part number "113301".

2. Image labeled "21" shows the same cabinet viewed from a different angle with the door fully open. A detail is highlighted showing the attachment of a back panel to the frame of the cabinet using screws. The panel is being aligned with the vertical edges of the cabinet frame.

Both images are part of a step-by-step assembly guide, using line drawings for clarity.
