A person is depicted in the process of attaching a horizontal rail or bar across the width of the structure. The illustration includes an inset close-up showing the attachment detail, where two screws are being used to secure the rail to the side panels. The number "2x" indicates that this action should be repeated twice. The overall drawing style is simple and schematic, typical of furniture assembly instructions.
