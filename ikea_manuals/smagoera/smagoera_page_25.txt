1. The top left illustration shows a warning sign indicating that a hearing protection device should be worn. Next to it, there is an image of a wall-mounted cabinet with a mirror. The mirror has a scribble on it, possibly indicating it is broken or has a defect.

2. The top right illustration depicts a person's arm reaching towards a cabinet or shelf. There is a large "X" over the image, suggesting that this action is incorrect or should be avoided.

3. The bottom illustration shows a tall, empty cabinet frame with an open door. There is a detailed inset circle showing a screw being inserted into a hole on the cabinet, with a note indicating to repeat this action four times.
