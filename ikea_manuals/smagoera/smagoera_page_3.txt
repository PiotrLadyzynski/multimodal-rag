smagoera page 3. The image you've provided appears to be a text page from an instruction manual, possibly containing warnings or important notices in various languages. It does not contain visual assembly instructions or illustrations of furniture parts or steps. Therefore, I'm unable to provide descriptions of IKEA assembly instructions for the Tuffing or Freda, or any specific assembly steps from this image. Please provide the specific pages with visual instructions for a detailed description.
