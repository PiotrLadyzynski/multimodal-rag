1. Image labeled "10" shows the initial steps of assembling the top part of the furniture. It illustrates a flat rectangular panel being aligned horizontally above two side panels that are standing vertically. An arrow indicates that the top panel should be placed down onto the side panels.

2. Image labeled "11" shows the next step where the top panel has been placed onto the side panels, creating a closed top for the structure. An arrow points downward, indicating the placement of the top panel onto the side panels to secure them together.

Both images are clear and use simple line drawings to demonstrate the assembly process, with arrows to guide the direction of assembly.
