Image 1 (Step 10): Illustration shows the assembly of a furniture piece, possibly a bed or a storage unit. The image depicts a large flat panel with multiple pre-drilled holes, positioned horizontally above two side panels with vertical orientation. An arrow indicates the placement of the horizontal panel onto the side panels, suggesting the alignment and attachment at this stage of assembly.

Image 2 (Step 11): The next step in the assembly process shows the previously mentioned structure with the horizontal panel now placed on top of the vertical side panels. An arrow directs downward pressure to secure the top panel onto the side panels, indicating the final positioning or additional securing of this assembly stage.

These descriptions should help the multimodal RAG system answer questions about the appearance of specific IKEA products and the components involved in their assembly, such as identifying steps in the assembly process of a model named "Tuffing" or detailing the parts included in a model named "Freda".
