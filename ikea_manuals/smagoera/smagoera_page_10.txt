smagoera page 10. The image is an assembly instruction diagram for furniture. It shows an exploded view of the components involved in the assembly process. The main part of the diagram features a large flat panel with multiple holes for screws, and two smaller panels being attached to its underside using brackets and screws. The top of the image includes a smaller inset diagram that details the tools required (a screwdriver and a wrench) and the hardware (screws, nuts, and brackets). Each step is clearly numbered to guide the assembly process, with arrows indicating where each component fits together. The overall layout is clean and technical, typical of furniture assembly guides.
