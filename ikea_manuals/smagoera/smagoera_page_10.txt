smagoera page 10. Alternative text for image: "Step 1 of IKEA assembly instructions shows the initial setup for assembling a piece of furniture. The image includes a detailed illustration of a screwdriver tightening a screw into a circular metal piece, which is labeled with a '10x' indicating multiple screws are needed. Below this, two long, narrow panels are depicted, each with multiple pre-drilled holes for screws. The panels are shown being aligned parallel to each other with the help of metal brackets at the ends. A small inset diagram lists the parts needed for this step, including screws, dowels, and a screwdriver."
