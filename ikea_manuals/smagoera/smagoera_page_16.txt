smagoera page 16. The image shows an illustrated assembly instruction for furniture. It features a rectangular box-like structure, possibly a drawer or a cabinet, with a detailed inset showing the attachment of a handle or knob. The inset illustrates a screw being inserted into the handle, which is then attached to the front panel of the structure. The number "5x" next to the screw and handle indicates that this step should be repeated five times. The image is labeled with the number "12" at the top, suggesting it is part of a sequence of assembly steps.
