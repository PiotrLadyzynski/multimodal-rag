Image 1 (Step 26): Illustration shows a flat, rectangular panel with multiple pre-drilled holes. Above the panel, there are screws and a tool depicted, indicating the attachment of these screws into the panel. The number "6x" suggests that six screws are to be used in this step.

Image 2 (Step 27): This image displays two vertical, narrow panels, resembling the sides of a cabinet or wardrobe. Arrows indicate the movement of these panels towards each other, suggesting they are to be aligned or connected. Close-up insets show the detailed mechanism of screws being tightened into a hinge or bracket, also marked with "6x" to denote the number of screws involved.
