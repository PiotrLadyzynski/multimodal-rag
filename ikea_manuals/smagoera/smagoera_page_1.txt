smagoera page 1. The image provided is a cover page from an IKEA assembly instruction manual for a product named "SMÅGÖRA." The image features a line drawing of a tall, narrow wardrobe with a single door, which has a handle in the middle. The wardrobe appears to have a simple, streamlined design typical of IKEA products. The top of the image includes the product name "SMÅGÖRA" in large, bold letters, and the IKEA logo along with the text "Design and Quality IKEA of Sweden" is positioned at the bottom. This image does not show any assembly steps or include a step number in the corner, as it is likely the introductory page of the manual.
