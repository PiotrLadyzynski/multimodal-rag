smagoera page 31. Alternative text for the image from IKEA assembly instructions:

"This image displays step 6 of assembling a piece of furniture, possibly a cabinet or wardrobe. The image is divided into three rows, each containing a sequence of illustrations. In the top row, there is a single vertical panel with holes, and an arrow indicates the insertion of a dowel into the top hole. The middle row shows three illustrations: the first depicts a hand placing a dowel into the top hole of the panel, the second shows a dowel being inserted into the middle hole, and the third illustrates insertion into the bottom hole. The bottom row mirrors the middle row with similar actions being performed on another identical panel. Each step is clearly marked with arrows showing the direction and placement of the dowels."

This description should help the multimodal RAG system answer questions about the assembly process depicted in the image, such as the actions performed in step 6 and the parts involved in this step.
