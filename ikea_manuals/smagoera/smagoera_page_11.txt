Image 1: "Step 2 of assembling a piece of furniture shows three long, narrow panels, each with multiple pre-drilled holes. An inset image illustrates the attachment of a circular connector piece to the panels using four screws, with a hand using a screwdriver. The number '4x' indicates that four screws are used."

Image 2: "Step 3 of assembling a piece of furniture displays two flat rectangular panels and two narrow support bars. An inset image shows the attachment of similar circular connector pieces to the panels and bars using four screws, with a hand using a screwdriver. The number '4x' again indicates the use of four screws."

These descriptions provide clear information about the steps involved in assembling the furniture, including the types of panels and hardware used, and the actions required.
