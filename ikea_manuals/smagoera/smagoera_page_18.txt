smagoera page 18. Alternative text for the image: "Step 14 of IKEA assembly instructions. The image shows two different configurations of a furniture part, possibly a bracket or fixture, in the top section. Below, there is a detailed illustration of a vertical furniture piece, resembling a side panel of a wardrobe or bookshelf. The panel has pre-drilled holes and slots for assembly. The image includes an inset close-up showing the correct orientation of a screw being inserted into a hole, with a '2x' label indicating that this action should be repeated twice. The instructions emphasize the correct orientation of the screw with a 'Yes' icon next to the correct method and a 'No' icon next to an incorrect method, which shows the screw at an angle. The bottom of the image includes a detailed parts list with specific screws, a dowel, and a locking mechanism, all laid out on a dotted outline of a rectangle, suggesting precise placement or measurement requirements."
