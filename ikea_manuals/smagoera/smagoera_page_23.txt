The image depicts step 1 of assembling a piece of furniture, possibly a wardrobe or cabinet named "Freda". The illustration shows a tall, narrow cabinet with a single door, featuring a drawer at the bottom and a shelf inside. The door has a handle on the right side. The dimensions are marked on the drawing: the height is 46 units, the width of the body is 7 units, and the width including the door is 8 units. The depth is indicated as 25 units. The bottom of the cabinet is labeled with the number 24, and the back panel is labeled with the number 23. A small inset diagram shows a screw being inserted into a hole, indicating the assembly process.

**Image 2 Description:**
This image represents step 19 in the assembly instructions for a piece of furniture, possibly a bed named "Tuffing". The main diagram shows a side view of a partially assembled bed frame with a curved lower end, suggesting it is a lower bunk or a single bed. The frame is being secured with four screws, as indicated by the detail showing a screwdriver and screw with the numbers 100677 and 114259. The inset at the top left corner of the image provides a top-down view of the bed frame, highlighting the placement of the screws along the length of the frame. The numbers 1 and 2 are marked on the frame in this inset, possibly indicating the order of assembly or parts of the frame.

Based on these descriptions:
- The "Tuffing" appears to be a bed, specifically a lower bunk or single bed with a curved lower end.
- The "Freda" includes parts such as a cabinet body, a door with a handle, a drawer, a shelf, and various screws for assembly.
- Step 4 of assembling the "Tuffing" is not depicted in these images, but step 19 involves securing the bed frame with screws using a screwdriver.
