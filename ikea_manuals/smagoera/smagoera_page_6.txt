The image is divided into three sections, each depicting different steps and tools required for assembling a piece of furniture. In the top section, there are illustrations of various tools and hardware needed for assembly. These include a screwdriver, a wrench, a hammer, a measuring tape, and various screws and fasteners. Each tool and piece of hardware is clearly labeled with its name and size.

The middle section of the image shows a detailed diagram of a wooden panel with specific holes and fittings marked for screws. There is a close-up inset showing a screw being inserted into a hole with a screwdriver.

The bottom section of the image features three cartoon figures engaged in the assembly process. The first figure is shown with a red "X" over it, indicating an incorrect method, where the figure attempts to assemble without assistance. The next two figures are shown working together to correctly assemble the panels, emphasizing the importance of cooperation in the assembly process.

This image is labeled as step 6 in the assembly instructions, indicating it is part of a sequence in assembling the furniture.
