smagoera page 6. The image is a page from an instruction manual, likely for assembling furniture or equipment, divided into several panels:

1. The top panel shows a cartoon figure pointing to a collection of tools and hardware items. These include various types of screwdrivers, a hammer, a drill, screws, nuts, and bolts, all labeled with their dimensions or types.

2. The second panel features two diagrams: one of a flat object with holes and measurements indicated (8.5 mm and 6 mm), and another showing a vertical section of a structure with a screw being inserted into a hole.

3. The third panel depicts a cartoon figure with a large "X" over it, indicating incorrect action, where the figure is attempting to balance on a rotating office chair while using tools.

4. The fourth panel shows three cartoon figures: one standing on a stable platform using a tool correctly, and two others observing or assisting.

Each panel is designed to visually guide the user through correct tool usage and safety precautions during assembly.
