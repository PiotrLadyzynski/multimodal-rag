An arrow indicates the attachment of the hardware to the circular objects, which are then to be attached to the panels.

Step 7: Similar to step 6, this step shows two rectangular panels with pre-drilled holes. There are ten circular objects and corresponding hardware pieces. An arrow indicates the attachment of the hardware to the circular objects, which are then to be attached to the panels.

Each step is illustrated with clear, exploded views to show where each component fits relative to the others.
