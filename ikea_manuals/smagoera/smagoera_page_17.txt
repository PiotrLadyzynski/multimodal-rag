smagoera page 17. The image is an illustration from an assembly manual, showing step 13 in the process of assembling a piece of furniture, possibly a cabinet or a dresser. The main part of the image features a large, rectangular, horizontal cabinet with multiple vertical lines indicating separate panels or sections. The cabinet is shown with its back facing up, suggesting that assembly is focused on attaching parts to this area.

Below the main image, there are three smaller insets. The first inset on the left shows two types of fasteners, each labeled with the number "8x," indicating the quantity needed. The second inset in the middle displays a hand pressing down on one of the fasteners with a "click!" sound effect, indicating the fastener snaps into place. The third inset on the right shows a crossed-out image of a power tool, suggesting that such tools should not be used for this step of the assembly.
