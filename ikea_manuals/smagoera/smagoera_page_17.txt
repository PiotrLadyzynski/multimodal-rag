smagoera page 17. Alternative text for image: "Step 13 of IKEA assembly instructions shows a rectangular cabinet with multiple vertical lines indicating pre-drilled holes for screws. The image includes a close-up view of two components being connected: a cam lock fitting into a cam lock nut. The number '8x' suggests that this action should be repeated eight times. Visual instructions indicate to turn the cam lock clockwise to secure it, as demonstrated by a hand using a screwdriver. A warning icon advises against using a power tool for this step."
