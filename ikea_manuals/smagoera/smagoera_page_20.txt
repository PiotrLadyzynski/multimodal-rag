The door is slightly ajar, revealing a vertical row of holes on the inside, likely for adjustable shelving. At the top of the cabinet, a screw is being inserted into a pre-drilled hole, secured by a screwdriver. The action is emphasized by a curved arrow around the screwdriver, indicating the motion to tighten the screw. In the bottom left corner, a magnified detail shows the screw and screwdriver, with a double arrow indicating the tightening action. The background is plain, focusing attention on the assembly process.
