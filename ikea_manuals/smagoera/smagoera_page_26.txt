smagoera page 26. The image depicts two steps, numbered 23 and 24, from an IKEA assembly instruction manual for a piece of furniture.

Step 23: The image shows a tall, narrow cabinet with a single door and a shelf inside. The focus is on the top right corner of the cabinet where a hinge is being attached to the door. A close-up inset shows a screwdriver securing a screw into the hinge, with a note indicating that two screws should be used.

Step 24: This step continues with the hinge installation. The main image shows the same cabinet, focusing on the top right corner. An arrow points from the hinge on the door to the cabinet's frame, indicating the attachment of the hinge to the frame. A close-up inset illustrates how the hinge should be positioned on the frame, with a downward arrow indicating the motion for securing the hinge. The inset also notes the use of two screws for this part of the assembly.

These images are designed to guide the user through the process of attaching hinges to the cabinet door and securing them to the main frame of the cabinet.
