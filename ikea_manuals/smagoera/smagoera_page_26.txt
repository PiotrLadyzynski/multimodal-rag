1. Image 23: Shows a tall, narrow cabinet with a single door. The door is open, revealing the interior structure which includes a top shelf and a bottom shelf. An illustration inset shows a close-up of a hinge being attached to the door with screws, indicating the step involves securing the door to the cabinet frame.

2. Image 24: Continues from the previous step, showing the same cabinet with the door slightly ajar. An arrow points downward, indicating the door should be closed. A separate inset illustration shows a close-up of a lock mechanism on the door, with an arrow demonstrating the insertion of the key into the lock, suggesting this step involves securing the door with a lock.

Both images include labels and numerical steps (23 and 24) to guide the assembly process, and each step is marked with the number of times an action should be repeated (e.g., "2x" for attaching the hinges twice).
