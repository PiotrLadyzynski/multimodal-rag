Image 1: "Step 8 of assembling furniture shows two vertical panels being attached to a horizontal base panel. Each vertical panel has multiple pre-drilled holes and is aligned perpendicularly to the base panel. Arrows indicate the downward placement of the vertical panels onto the base."

Image 2: "Step 9 of assembling furniture illustrates the attachment of a single vertical panel to a horizontal base panel, similar to the previous step. The focus is on the fastening mechanism, showing a close-up of a bolt and a locking nut being combined. The number '5x' next to these hardware pieces suggests that five sets of these are required for this step."

These descriptions should help the multimodal RAG system answer questions about the assembly steps and the appearance of parts in the instructions.
