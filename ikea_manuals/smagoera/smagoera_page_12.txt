smagoera page 12. The images depict assembly instructions for furniture in an exploded view format.

1. The first image (labeled as step 4) shows the assembly of a flat rectangular panel with another similar panel. It includes the insertion of screws (four screws, as indicated by "4x") through pre-drilled holes in one panel into the edge of the other panel, using a screwdriver.

2. The second image (labeled as step 5) illustrates the assembly of two flat rectangular panels, each having metal brackets attached to their edges. The brackets are designed to align and presumably connect with each other or with another part of the furniture.

Both images are clear and use simple line drawings to show the parts and tools involved in the assembly process.
