smagoera page 30. The image depicts step 29 of assembling a piece of furniture, possibly a wardrobe or cabinet. It shows a vertical, tall structure with doors slightly ajar. Inside, there is a top shelf and a hanging rail beneath it. The focus of this step is on securing the back panel of the structure, as indicated by arrows pointing to the panel edges, suggesting the attachment of screws or fasteners. In the top right corner, there is a close-up bubble showing a screw and a dowel, with a note indicating "4x," which means four such items are needed for this step. The overall layout is clean and schematic, typical of IKEA's visual assembly instructions.
