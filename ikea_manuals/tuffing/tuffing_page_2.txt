tuffing page 2. Alternative text for the IKEA assembly instruction image:

The image consists of six panels, each depicting different steps in assembling a piece of furniture, with large numbers in the corners indicating the sequence of steps.

1. The first panel (Step 1) shows a figure standing next to an unassembled furniture frame, holding a tool (screwdriver). A warning symbol indicates not to use a drill.

2. The second panel (Step 2) depicts two figures. One figure is holding a crossbar incorrectly, marked by a large "X" to indicate a mistake, while the other figure watches.

3. The third panel (Step 3) shows the same two figures now correctly assembling the crossbars onto the frame, without the "X" mark.

4. The fourth panel (Step 4) features a single figure tightening screws on the assembled frame using a hand tool, with a specific focus on the screw connections.

5. The fifth panel (Step 5) shows a figure puzzled by an incorrect assembly, with a question mark above their head, indicating confusion or a problem.

6. The sixth panel (Step 6) shows a figure calling IKEA customer service for help, holding a piece of the furniture and a phone, with the IKEA logo visible on the phone screen.

This image is designed to guide the assembly of a piece of furniture, showing both correct and incorrect methods, and offers a resource for help in the final panel.
