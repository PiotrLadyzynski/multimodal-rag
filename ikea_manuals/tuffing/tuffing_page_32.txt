At the top, a long metal rail is depicted with a label indicating '2x' to signify two pieces are needed. Below, a sequence of detailed illustrations demonstrates the attachment of brackets to the rail. The first image in the sequence shows a bracket being aligned with holes on the rail. The subsequent images show a hand using a tool to screw fasteners into the bracket to secure it to the rail. Each step is clearly marked with arrows pointing to the screw locations and the direction of movement for securing the bracket."
