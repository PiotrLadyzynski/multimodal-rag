2. Below, there is a sequence of four images showing the detailed steps to attach components:
   - The first image shows a hand positioning a metal bracket onto the edge of a panel.
   - The second image shows a hand screwing a bolt through the bracket into the panel.
   - The third image shows the bolt being tightened with a tool.
   - The fourth image shows a hand pressing down on the bracket to ensure it is securely attached.
3. The main diagram beneath these steps shows an elongated structure made of several panels connected by the brackets, indicating the assembly progress.

The images are designed to guide the user through the assembly process with visual step-by-step instructions.
