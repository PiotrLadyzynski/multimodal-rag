tuffing page 11. Alternative text for the IKEA assembly instruction image:

"This image is part of the assembly instructions for a piece of IKEA furniture. In the top section of the image, labeled as step 7, there are two long horizontal bars depicted. One bar has a series of evenly spaced holes along its length, and the other bar has no holes. The image indicates that the bar with holes should be used, as shown by a check mark, while the bar without holes is marked with an 'X' indicating it should not be used.

In the lower section of the image, labeled as step 8, the assembly process involves attaching vertical posts to a horizontal frame. The diagram shows two vertical posts being inserted into fittings on the corners of a horizontal frame. There are arrows indicating the direction in which the posts should be inserted. Additionally, there is an inset close-up showing a screw and a dowel being used to secure the posts to the frame, with a note specifying to use four screws and dowels, labeled as '100092' and '100001' respectively.

This image is designed to guide the assembler through the correct selection and attachment of parts during the assembly process."

Based on this description, the system should be able to answer:
- What does the Tuffing look like? (Though not directly answerable from this image alone, it suggests a structure with vertical posts and horizontal frames.)
- What parts are included in the Freda? (This question cannot be answered from this image as it does not specify the furniture model 'Freda'.)
- What is step 4 of assembling the Tuffing? (This image does not show step 4, so it cannot provide that information directly.)
