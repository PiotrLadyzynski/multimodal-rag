tuffing page 11. The image contains two sections of an assembly instruction manual.

1. The top section shows a sequence of three diagrams illustrating the correct and incorrect ways to align and connect long, narrow panels. The first diagram indicates the correct alignment with a check mark, showing the panels side by side. The second and third diagrams show incorrect alignments, marked with an "X," where the panels are misaligned or overlapping incorrectly.

2. The bottom section depicts the assembly of a structure with vertical posts and horizontal beams. It shows a detailed step-by-step process:
   - Diagram 1: Inserting a screw into a hole on a vertical post.
   - Diagram 2: Attaching a horizontal beam to the vertical post using the screw.
   - An inset circle magnifies the screw and nut being tightened with a wrench, indicating the use of four screws and nuts for the assembly.

The diagrams are labeled with numbers to guide the assembly process, and there are small icons indicating hands performing actions, such as holding a wrench or aligning beams.
