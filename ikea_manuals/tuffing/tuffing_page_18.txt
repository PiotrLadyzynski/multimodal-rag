tuffing page 18. Alternative text for the image: "Step 16 of the IKEA assembly instructions for a piece of furniture, possibly a bunk bed named Tuffing. The image shows a line drawing of a nearly complete bunk bed frame with a person in the process of assembling it. The person is depicted as a simplified, gender-neutral figure, standing to the right of the bed, holding a piece of fabric or netting that is being attached to the top side of the bed frame. The bed has a ladder attached to the left side and guard rails on the top bunk. The image is numbered '16' in the top left corner, indicating this is the sixteenth step in the assembly process."
