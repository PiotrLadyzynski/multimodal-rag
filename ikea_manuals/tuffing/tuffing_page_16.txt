Image 1 (Step 13): The image shows the assembly step for a piece of furniture, specifically focusing on securing components together. It depicts a close-up view of a screw, a dowel, and a locking mechanism, indicating the insertion of the dowel into a pre-drilled hole and the screw being tightened into place. The illustration includes directional arrows showing the motion of assembly and a clear label of "1x" for the quantity of parts used in this step. The background shows a schematic of a partially assembled furniture frame, highlighting where the components should be attached.

Image 2 (Step 14): This image illustrates a later step in the furniture assembly, featuring a nearly complete bunk bed. The upper bunk is shown with a mattress and a safety railing being indicated for installation. The lower part of the image includes a ladder and a safety net, with dotted lines suggesting their respective placements on the bunk bed frame. The image emphasizes the importance of securing these elements properly to ensure safety and stability.

These descriptions should help the multimodal RAG system answer questions about the appearance of the "Tuffing" bunk bed, the parts included in the "Freda" (if it were depicted), and specific assembly steps such as step 4 for the "Tuffing".
