tuffing page 15. The image contains two instructional diagrams labeled as steps 11 and 12, likely from an assembly manual.

Step 11 shows the assembly of a hinge mechanism. It includes three components: two vertical, rectangular parts and one smaller, cylindrical part. Arrows indicate the insertion of the cylindrical part into holes in the rectangular parts. There is also a depiction of a screwdriver, suggesting the use of screws for assembly.

Step 12 illustrates the attachment of two elongated, flat pieces with a hinge. An arrow shows the motion of folding one piece over the other along the hinge.

The diagrams are clear and use simple line drawings to convey the assembly steps, with numbers and arrows to guide the process.
