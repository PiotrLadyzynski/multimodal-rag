The top panel shows an illustration of a partially assembled metal bunk bed frame, highlighting the attachment of a long, horizontal bar to the frame using a screwdriver. The middle panel depicts a warning sign against overtightening, with illustrations showing correct and incorrect screw tightness. The bottom panel illustrates the attachment of a fabric component to the bunk bed frame, with arrows indicating the direction to insert and secure the fabric. Insets show a close-up of the screw being tightened and a warning label on the fabric to check the assembly manual.
