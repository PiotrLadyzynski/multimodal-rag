tuffing page 24. Alternative text description: "Step 22 of the IKEA assembly instructions for a bunk bed, possibly the Tuffing model. The image shows a line drawing of a person in a casual outfit, assembling the upper frame of a metal bunk bed. The person is attaching a horizontal bar to the side of the upper bunk. The bed frame is nearly complete, with both the lower and upper bunks outlined, indicating a sturdy, rectangular structure. The image is clear and focused on the assembly action, with no additional parts or tools visible."
