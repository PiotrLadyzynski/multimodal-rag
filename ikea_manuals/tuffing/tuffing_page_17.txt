tuffing page 17. Alternative text for the image from IKEA assembly instruction:

"Step 15 of assembling the Tuffing bunk bed. The image shows the upper frame of the bunk bed being secured to the vertical support posts. Two metal tubes are aligned horizontally across the top of two vertical posts. The assembly requires two screws and a hex key, both of which are being used by a hand illustrated in the image to tighten the screws into the posts. The components and tools are clearly labeled with part numbers and quantities, indicating the use of two screws (part number 100214) for this step. The overall structure is partially assembled, suggesting this is a mid to late step in the assembly process."
