Image 1: Step 26 in the assembly instructions shows a partially assembled metal bunk bed frame, identified as the Tuffing. The image depicts the addition of a safety rail on the upper bunk. The illustration includes an inset showing the attachment of the rail using two screws (100049) and a tool, likely an Allen wrench. The instruction indicates to repeat the process on the opposite side, as denoted by "2x."

Image 2: Step 27 continues with the assembly of the Tuffing bunk bed. This step focuses on securing the ladder to the frame of the bunk bed. The image shows the ladder being attached at two points, each secured with a bolt (100017) and a nut (100006). The inset provides a close-up view of the bolt and nut assembly, emphasizing the use of a wrench to tighten the connection. The instruction also indicates to repeat the bolt and nut attachment on the other side of the ladder, marked by "2x."

These descriptions should enable the multimodal RAG system to answer questions about the appearance of the Tuffing, the parts included in the assembly, and specific assembly steps such as step 4.
