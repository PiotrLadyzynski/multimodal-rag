**Image 1: Step 35**
The image depicts step 35 in the assembly of a bunk bed, possibly the Tuffing model. It shows an isometric view of the partially assembled metal frame of the bunk bed. The frame includes the top and bottom bunk structures with side railings and ladder rungs. The illustration highlights the attachment of 14 screws at various connection points on the frame, using a screwdriver. The screws are shown in a small inset circle, indicating the type and quantity needed for this step.

**Image 2: Step 36**
The image illustrates step 36 in the assembly process. It continues with the same bunk bed frame, focusing on securing additional components. A hand is shown using a small hammer to tap in two dowels into holes located at the upper corners of the bed frame, ensuring the stability and alignment of the structure. The dowels are displayed in a small inset circle, specifying the quantity and type required.

These descriptions should enable the system to answer questions about the appearance of the Tuffing bunk bed, the parts included in the assembly, and specific assembly steps such as step 4.
