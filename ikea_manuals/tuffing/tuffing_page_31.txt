tuffing page 31. Alternative text for IKEA assembly instruction image:

This image depicts step 30 of assembling a piece of IKEA furniture. The top part of the image shows a completed frame of what appears to be a bunk bed, with emphasis on securing the upper bunk. An inset illustration indicates the correct orientation of a component, suggesting it should not be upside down. The lower part of the image illustrates the assembly of a slatted bed base. A long metal bar is shown with seven holes, and the action of inserting screws into these holes is demonstrated. Each screw is being secured into a corresponding fitting on the slats of the bed base, which are laid out flat across the floor. The image is clear and detailed, focusing on the correct placement and securing of the bed slats to ensure stability and safety.
