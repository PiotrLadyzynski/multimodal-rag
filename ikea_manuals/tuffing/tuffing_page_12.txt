tuffing page 12. Alternative text for the image: "Step 9 of assembling the Tuffing bunk bed from IKEA. The image shows an overhead view of the partially assembled lower bunk frame. A hand-drawn figure is using a tool to secure four screws into the corner of the frame, where a vertical post meets the horizontal bed rail. The screws and tool are highlighted with an arrow indicating the action. A small parts box is depicted to the side, showing additional screws and components needed for this step."
