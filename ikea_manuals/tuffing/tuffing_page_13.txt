tuffing page 13. Alternative text for the IKEA assembly instruction image:

"This image displays step 6 of assembling a piece of IKEA furniture, possibly a bunk bed named Tuffing. The top part of the image shows an almost complete lower frame of the bunk bed with four vertical posts attached to a horizontal frame. The frame is depicted without the mattress. An arrow points to the insertion of a dowel into one of the frame's holes, indicating the next step in the assembly process. Below, there are detailed illustrations showing the attachment of a horizontal support beam to the vertical posts. Number labels 1, 2, and 3 are placed next to the corresponding components and actions, indicating the sequence of assembly steps: inserting a screw into a pre-drilled hole in the vertical post (step 1), securing the beam with a screw (step 2), and a close-up of a screw being tightened with a tool (step 3)."

This description should help the multimodal RAG system answer questions about the appearance of the Tuffing, the parts included in the assembly, and specific assembly steps like step 4.
