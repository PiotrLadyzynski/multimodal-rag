tuffing page 23. Alternative text for the image: "Step 21 of the IKEA assembly instructions for a bunk bed, possibly the Tuffing model. The image shows a nearly complete bunk bed frame with both upper and lower beds in place. The frame is depicted with a guard rail installed on the upper bed, and a ladder is shown attached to the frame. The focus of this step appears to be on securing the ladder, as indicated by the hand tools and tightening action symbols near the ladder's connection points to the bunk bed frame."
