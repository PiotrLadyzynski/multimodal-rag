Image 1: Step 33 of the assembly instructions shows a detailed view of the upper corner of a metal bunk bed frame, specifically focusing on the attachment of a circular component. The inset highlights the insertion of 14 screws into pre-drilled holes to secure this part of the frame. The overall image depicts the bunk bed with a metal ladder and safety rails on the top bunk.

Image 2: Step 34 of the assembly instructions depicts the same metal bunk bed. This step focuses on the placement of a flat metal piece that serves as a support or barrier, being inserted horizontally into the frame of the top bunk. An arrow indicates the direction in which the piece should be slid into place, fitting into the frame's side rails.

These descriptions should help the multimodal RAG system answer questions about the appearance of the Tuffing bunk bed, the parts included in the assembly, and specific steps such as step 4 of assembling the Tuffing.
