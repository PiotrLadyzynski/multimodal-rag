tuffing page 6. The image appears to be an instructional diagram from an assembly manual, likely for furniture or a similar item. It is divided into two main sections labeled "1" and "2".

1. The first section shows two components: a flat, rectangular panel with pre-drilled holes and arrows indicating the direction of insertion for dowels or screws, and a set of long, slender items, possibly dowels or metal rods.

2. The second section is more complex and shows the assembly process:
   - Step 3: A long, cylindrical rod is depicted with an arrow indicating it should be inserted through a hole in a bracket.
   - Step 4: A detailed view of a bracket attached to a panel, with holes for screws or dowels. The diagram indicates the insertion of a dowel or screw into the bracket.
   - The main part of this section shows the assembly of a larger structure, possibly a frame, where the panel from the first section is being attached to elongated rods or beams, using the brackets shown in the detailed views.

Each step includes small flame icons, suggesting a warning to keep the item away from heat or to handle a specific part with care due to potential heat during assembly.
