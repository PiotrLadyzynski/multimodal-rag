tuffing page 25. Alternative text for the image: "Step 23 of IKEA assembly instructions for a piece of furniture. The image shows a nearly complete metal frame structure with two levels. The upper level is depicted with a mesh base, suggesting it is a bunk bed or similar item. In the top left corner, there is a warning symbol indicating not to twist a screw, accompanied by an inset illustration showing the correct alignment of a screw in a hole. Below this, a hand-drawn arrow points to a specific joint on the structure, indicating where to insert and tighten two screws, as denoted by the number '2x' next to the screws. The bottom right corner features a close-up view of a hand using a tool to secure a screw into the frame."

Based on this description, the system should be able to answer the following questions:
- What does the Tuffing look like? (Assuming the structure is the Tuffing, it appears as a metal frame bunk bed with a mesh base on the upper level.)
- What parts are included in the Freda? (This question cannot be answered from the provided image as it does not specify if the structure is the Freda.)
- What is step 4 of assembling the Tuffing? (This question cannot be answered from the provided image as it depicts step 23, not step 4.)
