tuffing page 22. Alternative text for image: "Step 20 of assembling the Tuffing bunk bed from IKEA. The main image shows the upper and lower frames of the bunk bed, with the upper frame being secured to the vertical support posts. Arrows indicate the direction to slide the upper frame onto the posts. A smaller inset image at the bottom left shows a close-up of a hand using a wrench to tighten a bolt (labeled 100049) into a nut (labeled 100050) to secure the frame, with a count of '2x' indicating that this action should be repeated twice. The parts and tools are clearly labeled with numbers for easy identification."
